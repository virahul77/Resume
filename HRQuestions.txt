    Success has no deadline.
Q-> What is the difference between ""Group"" and ""Team""?
    A team is a number of people who work together to accomplish a shared purpose or goal. Each team is the sum of its parts, which means members of the team rely on one another to accomplish the outcome.

    In short, a group is a number of people who work together. They have individual goals that they work toward collectively. While groups work toward separate goals, they have a related interest or identity that brings them together.

    In a work group, group members are independent from one another and have individual accountability. On the other hand, in a team, team members share a mutual accountability and work closely together to solve problems. These dynamics inform the way tasks are handled and overall collaboration.

Q-> How do you work with an unreliable teammate?
    Identify employee behaviour
    Identify cause and understanding action 
    Communicate with team for solution
    Informing seniour authority if neccessary or out of control means take propriate action

Q-> How do you handle constructive criticism?
    Avoid immediately reacting. Feedback can engage our fight or flight response and turn a theoretically helpful session into an adrenaline-filled challenge. Before responding, take a deep breath and resist the urge to react, respond, or argue.

    If need be, remind yourself that constructive criticism can help you improve. Even if you didn’t know this feedback was coming, try to remember that this constructive criticism is being offered with your best interests at heart.

    Listen to understand—not to respond. When someone is offering constructive criticism, listen without formulating a reply or a defensive response to the feedback. Keep in mind that the person is offering feedback in order to try to help you, and try to listen with an open mind.

    Connect the feedback to your role, not to yourself. Feedback feels personal because we think people are criticizing us. But in a business setting, constructive criticism is usually based on your role. Good feedback can help you improve in your job and often isn’t as personal as it feels.

    Thank the person giving you feedback. Giving constructive feedback is hard. Thank the person for their energy and effort in helping you improve.

    Ask questions, but don’t challenge the feedback. Though you shouldn’t challenge or refute the feedback, it’s ok to ask questions and brainstorm how you can improve. If you aren’t ready to ask questions immediately after receiving critical feedback, that’s ok too. Set a follow up meeting to chat more about how you can improve
